Statistical Analysis of Big Five Psychometric Survey results
The goal of this project was to analyze responses from The Big Five Factor Inventory psychometric test and interpret the relationship between the scores and demographics
through mean differences and regression analysis. Throughout the process of this analysis, I explored and cleaned the data, performed general descriptive statistics, facilitated validity and reliability analysis, computed mean differences, and built multiple regression models.

The results of this project are summarized in the attached Powerpoint.
